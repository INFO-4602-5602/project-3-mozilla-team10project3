<h2>Project 3:</h2>
Due 4.6.2018 by 11:59pm through GitHub Classroom 
Projects may be submitted up to 3 days late, with a 10% penalty per day.

<h2>Overview: </h2>
Mozilla (the same company that created the Firefox web browser) recently conducted a survey on people's perceptions of privacy in our modern, highly connected world. The survey was aimed at understanding how comfortable people from all over the world are with various technology and how that comfort varies with things like device ownership or tech savvy. You can learn more about their data here: https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/11/01/10-fascinating-things-we-learned-when-we-asked-the-world-how-connected-are-you/?utm_source=newsletter-mofo&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=IOTsurveyresults&utm_content=callout&utm_term=4434975

The challenge is that, while they have a rich set of data, they don't have strong ways of exploring that data beyond basic spreadsheets and descriptive statistics. Your goal is to create a set of visualizations that allows them to engage with their data. The raw data is available at: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5UMbl9u1_wQc2l0ZTU0dTdoYnM/view

<h2>Minimum Requirements:</h2> 
Your project must:
<ul>
<li> Include a README.md file that outlines:
  <ul>
  <li>Information about your visualizations and what they show. Include information about interactions, preprocesses, and design as appropriate.</li>
  <li>Your design process (e.g., how did you go about designing, building, and refining your system? Why did you choose these representations?)</li>
  <li>Your team roles for each individual</li>
  <li>How to run your project</li></ul></li>
<li>Include at least three unique visualizations:
  <ul>
  <li>One visualization must include some element of geography</li>
  <li>One visualization must include categorical data</li>
  <li>Each visualization must be interactive</li>
  <li>Your set of three visualizations should support at least one meaningful comparison between related data attributes</li>
  <li>Your set of three visualizations should visualize at least five data attributes total</li></ul></li>
<li>Be able to work with any dataset of this format (e.g., the numbers are interchangable but the columns and document titles are fixed).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Above and Beyond:</h2> 
The above requirements are the minimum for a passing grade on this project. Some ideas to improve your project include:<ul>
<li>Uncertainty: Include sources of uncertainty in your representation, such as margins of error or variance in your computed data</li>
<li>Semantic Zoom: Allow yourself to zoom into different levels of hierarchically grouped data (e.g., data grouped by continent, device type, etc).</li>
<li>Missing Data: Not all rows have data for all columns. Design ways of handling missing data intelligently.</li>
<li>Perceptually-Informed Design: Integrate perceptual concepts into your visualization design and discuss how you've integrated those concepts in your readme.</li>
<li>Coordinated Views: Have two or more visualizations that interact with one another as you move through the data.</li>
<li>Style: Keep the style consistent across all your views, with an eye towards intelligently applying visual design.</li></ul>

<h2>Platforms:</h2> 
You can use any development platform you'd like so long as it is not proprietary (exception: MatLab as we have a University License). Your project readme should include step-by-step instructions on how to run your projects and it should run without me having to modify the code. You are welcome to use different platforms for each visualization.

Some platforms to look at include:
<ul>
<li>D3</li>
<li>R with ggplot</li>
<li>WebGL or Three.js</li>
<li>Processing or ProcessingJS</li>
<li>Google Maps API</li>
<li>Open Street Map API</li>
<li>Bokeh</li>
<li>Creatively engineered tangible/audio artifacts</li>
</ul>

If you would like to use a platform that will push you in creative ways but may not support all of the requirements of the project, please come talk to me. 

<h2>Submissions:</h2>
All submissions must be made through GitHub with a timestamp by 11:59pm on 4.6. Your submission files should include:
<ul>
<li>Your README</li>
<li>Your code and/or project</li>
</ul>
Note that each group only needs to submit one file. 

Each member of the team should also send Danielle & Jim a project post-mortem through email with the subject line "INFO 4602/5602: Project 3" documenting the following:
* What you worked on in the project
* What your teammates worked on in the project
* How you would rate your performance and why (out of 10 points)
* How you would rate each teammates' performance and why (out of 10 points)

These documents will be kept confidential and will factor into project grades. If you feel all of the team worked hard and performed well, please don't hesitate to tell me that (no curving is necessary on performance reviews :-))! Also, please keep in mind that different team members have different skillsets, roles, and experiences.

<h2>Grading: </h2>
The project will be scored out of 100 points total. Your project will be graded on four different criteria:
<ol>
<li> Creativity</li>
<li> Technical execution (how well does it meet the stakeholder's objectives?)</li>
<li> Design (both aesthetic and your visualization choices)</li>
<li> Project Post-Mortems</li>
</ol>
